  _explanation: 'Answer: <b><u>Closed reduction and casting</u></b> <br><br>Stable
    femoral shaft fractures (also known as "simple" or "nondisplaced" fractures)
    do not cause significant displacement of the fragtured bone fragments or damage
    to the surrounding tissues. Hence, can be treated with closed reduction and casting,
    which involves aligning the bone fragments and immobilizing the leg with a cast.'
